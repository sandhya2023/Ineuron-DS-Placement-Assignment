This allows the model to pay more attention to the minority class and prevent it from being overshadowed by the majority class. Most machine learning frameworks provide options for assigning class weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensemble Methods: Utilize ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to combine multiple models trained on different subsets of the imbalanced data. Ensemble methods can help improve model performance by reducing the bias towards the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation Metrics: Focus on evaluation metrics that are robust to imbalanced datasets. Accuracy alone may be misleading in the presence of class imbalance. Instead, consider metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), or precision-recall curve (PRC).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Anomaly Detection: Treat the imbalanced dataset as an anomaly detection problem. Train the model to recognize instances from the minority class as anomalies or outliers. This approach can be effective when the minority class represents rare or abnormal events.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Augmentation: Augment the minority class by introducing variations or perturbations to the existing instances. This can be done by techniques like rotation, scaling, or adding noise, thus increasing the diversity of the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Stratified Sampling: Ensure that the imbalanced dataset is properly stratified during train-validation-test splits. This ensures representative proportions of the minority and majority classes in each subset, providing a fair evaluation of the model's performance.\n",
